Road to OSCP -  by a brazilian ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

Repository with all my writups based on the OSCP report format

They are ordenate based on the geral grade of the 5 factors rated:

enumeration() - based in how much effort you need to find the vulnerable element
exploitation() - based in how much effort you need to exploit the vulnerable element
vulnerable element() - based in how different and uncommon the vulnerable element is 
vulnerability() - based in how different and uncommon the vulnerability is 
privilege escalation() - based in how much effort you need to escalate the privilege

1 - easy / very common
2 - need some little research but no big deal
3 - you need to think a little more to solve / vulnerability not very common
4 - hard to exploit or enumerate / very uncommon 
5 - very complex / I never heard about it 

The final grade is simple: the sum of the factors / 5
In the case of machines with no privilege escalation the final grade is the other factors / 4, they are a specific folder for this

NOTE: all ranks are based on MY OPINION!!! Of course you have yours and it's ok if your opinion is wrong, but just try to enjoy this content :)
