Repository with all my writups based on the OSCP report format

They are ordenate based on the geral grade of the 5 factors rated:

enumeration() - based in how much effort you need to find the vulnerable element</br>
exploitation() - based in how much effort you need to exploit the vulnerable element</br>
vulnerable element() - based in how different and uncommon the vulnerable element is </br>
vulnerability() - based in how different and uncommon the vulnerability is </br>
privilege escalation() - based in how much effort you need to escalate the privilege</br>

1 - easy / very common</br>
2 - need some little research but no big deal</br>
3 - you need to think a little more to solve / vulnerability not very common</br>
4 - hard to exploit or enumerate / very uncommon </br>
5 - very complex / I never heard about it </br>

The final grade is simple: the sum of the factors / 5</br>
In the case of machines with no privilege escalation the final grade is the other factors / 4, they are a specific folder for this

NOTE: all ranks are based on MY OPINION!!! Of course you have yours and it's ok if your opinion is wrong, but just try to enjoy this content :)
